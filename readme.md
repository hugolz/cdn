Compressed Delivery Network :D

# This project has moved to https://github.com/bowarc/storage_server

## Notes
Idk if any security is needed (ouside something against ddos or spam but i wont do that here)  
About file size, we rly should set a limit, even like a rly high one, but a limit is needed

Store different infos in the json ?
Maybe use ron instead of json
